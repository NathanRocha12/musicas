Right here, right now
I put the offer out
I don't want to chase you down
I know you see it

You run with me
And I can cut you free
Out of the drudgery and walls you keep in

So trade that typical for something colorful
And if it's crazy, live a little crazy
You can play it sensible, a king of conventional
Or you can risk it all and see

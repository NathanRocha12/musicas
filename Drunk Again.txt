Oh I didn't ask for the scars that I've been given
That's the price you pay for someone else's sinning
The preacher said that I'll find a reason
Don't have the heart to tell him I don't believe him
Oh I don't believe him
Some call it a habit, some call it a sin
Some call it a pattern

I don't know where this ends
They call me a daughter, but I don't believe them
Baptized in the water, don't feel any different
All I know it's a sign, and so I left up my hands
Worshipping Jesus
But I'm drunk again
Tell myself I'm a little too hard to save
Tired of waking up in my own grave
Bottles and Bibles next to my bed
Chasing the demons out of my head
Some call it a habit, some call it a sin
Some call it a pattern

I don't know where this ends
They call me a daughter, but I don't believe them
Baptized in the water, don't feel any different
All I know it's a sign, and so I left up my hands
Worshipping Jesus
But I'm drunk again
